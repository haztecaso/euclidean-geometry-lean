This gentle step-by-step introduction is ideal for graduate students and researchers who need to understand the ins and outs of the mathematical machinery, the role of logical rules therein, the essential contribution of definitions and the decisive nature of well-structured proofs. The authors begin with untyped lambda calculus and proceed to several fundamental type systems, including the well-known and powerful Calculus of Constructions. The book also covers the essence of proof checking and proof development, and the use of dependent type theory to formalise mathematics. The only prerequisite is a basic knowledge of undergraduate mathematics. Carefully chosen examples illustrate the theory throughout. Each chapter ends with a summary of the content, some historical context, suggestions for further reading and a selection of exercises to help readers familiarise themselves with the material.},

In the interests of readability and conciseness, we have investigated general-purpose abstractions for geometric reasoning, and have shown how these can simplify existing proofs. We have revised many of the existing definitions by introducing new types, and analysed the notion of rays and half-planes more deeply than Hilbert had originally. Finally, we have corrected subtle mistakes in Meikle‚Äôs mechanised axioms of Group III, forcing us to produce new corrected proofs of the early theorems.},
